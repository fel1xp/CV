# Felix Piercy
A driven Makers Academy graduate with a positive learning mindset, ready to thrive as a developer. At the beginning of a long-term career shift into software development. I continue to further my skillset beyond Makers Academy by working towards the Amazon Web Services Cloud Practitioner qualification and Kubernetes Udemy course. My key language strength is in Ruby as well as building confidence in JavaScript. I also have a keen interest in serverless software deployment and realising the benefits of a containerised world.

## My favourite coding projects

MakersBNB - a website where users can create a space to rent, and guests can request to book. This project was the most formative experience for me during the course as it involved conflict, building on existing concepts and beginning to style our applications. 

Notes Application - a JavaScript web app allowing the user to record notes, which are listed in an abbreviated form which can then be expanded. This project is significant to me because it exemplified fantastic teamwork. Working with 2 peers, we approached the project in a cohesive manner and were all very supportive of one another. We took time for self-learning and had a high-test coverage despite only spending 2 weeks on JS at this stage. 

Betwixt - My final project completed with 5 other talented Makers. Betwixt finds the mid-point between you and your friend, then recommending a variety of restaurants/bars/cafes for you to meet. The project uses Next.js and involved the integration of numerous APIs. 


## Key Skills & Attributes 

- Refined Process - throughout my Makers experience I have continued to refine my coding best practices and how I launch projects. From initial planning stages with CRC cards to TDD and final implementation with CI and CD, I am proud of the tools and procedure I have learnt during the course. 

- Communicator - Articulate and to the point, I break down problems and can explain them in plain English. Pair programming has been a central part of my software development course, providing daily opportunities to explain my code and how I have tackled problems - as well as listening to feedback and implementing improvements. 

- Problem solver - I have a variety of experience problem solving. I am proficient in tracing bugs in programmes and confident in tackling customer problems under time pressure. 

- Detail orientated - I have a keen eye for detail, writing programmes with the correct formatting and punctuation. Outside of coding, I have had to be meticulous in the paperwork and setup of COVID-19 testing kits. 

### Problem Solving Case Study 

At my previous role as a sales executive we were suffering from a low click through rate on Google Adverts. In order to solve this problem, our website needed SEO improvements and the wording of the Google Ads needed refreshing. I took action by downloading SEO improvement tools and making content changes to help the organisations website ranking. Furthermore, I refreshed the Google Ad text in relation to the website changes so that both adverts and website displayed a cohesive message. The result of this was a doubling of sales month-on-month from January through to March. 


### Curious Learner Case Study 

Continually improving my skillset and always interested in discovering the latest technology. The intensive software development course at Makers reflects my desire to learn new skills. I gained real experience building web applications end to end as well as participating in every workshop to facilitate my learning journey. My curiosity to learn new skills extends beyond Makers where I have begun the AWS Cloud Practitioner course after a discussion with a software developer and understanding the benefits of serverless/containerised deployment.
