# Felix Piercy
A driven Makers Academy graduate with a positive learning mindset, ready to thrive as a developer. At the beginning of a long-term career shift into software development. I continue to further my skillset beyond Makers Academy by working towards the Amazon Web Services Cloud Practioner qualification and Kubernetes Udemy course. My key langauge strength is in Ruby as well as building confidence in Javascript. I also have a keen interest in serverless software deployment and realising the benefits of a containerised world.

## My favourite coding projects

MakersBNB - a website where users are able to create a space to rent, and guests can request to book. This project was the most formative experience for me during the course as it involved conflict, building on existing concepts and beginning to style our applications. 

Notes Application - a Javascript web app  allowing the user to record notes, which are listed in an abbreviated form which can then be expanded. This project is significant to me because it emeplified fantastic teamwork. Working with 2 peers, we approached the project in a cohesive manner and were all very supportive of one another. We took time for self-learning and had a high test coverage despite only sppending 2 weeks on JS at this stage. 

Betwixt - My final project completed with 5 other talented Makers. Betwixt finds the mid-point between you and your friend, then recommending a variety of restaurants/bars/cafes for you to meet. The project is based on Next.js and involved the integration of numerous APIs. 


## Key Skills & Attributes 

- Refined Process - throughout my Makers experience I have continued to refine my coding best practices and how I launch projects. From initial planning stages with CRC cards to TDD and final implementation with CI and CD, I am proud of the tools and procedure I have learnt during the course. 

- Communicator - Articulate and to the point, I break down problems and can explain them in plain english. Pair programming has been a central part of my software development course, providing daily opportunities to explain my code and how I have tackled problems - as well as listening to feedback and implementing improvements. 

- Problem solver - I have a variety of experience problem solving. I am proficient in tracing bugs in programmes and confident in tackling customer problems under time pressure. 

- Detail orientated - I have a keen eye for detail, writing programmes with the correct formatting and punctuation. Outside of coding, I have had to be meticulous in the paperwork and setup of COVID-19 testing kits. 

### Problem Solving Case Study 

During my time at IQVIA as a COVID-19 tester, there were vast shortages of PPE and medical supplies across the UK which were critical to the role of organising and delivering COVID-19 testing kits. I managed to maintain a steady stream of test kits and was able to help colleagues who had struggled to acquire enough resources. This was achieved through early planning and communicating with my manager as well as supppliers. I placed small orders little and often to avoid stockpiling, as well as minimising wastage through careful use of kits. The result of this was that I was able to complete all my daily tasks whilst being able to help others achieve their targets. 

### Curious Learner Case Study 

Continually improving my skillset and always interested in discovering the latest technology. The intensive software development course at Makers illustrates my desire to learn new skills. I gained real experience building web applications end to end, and participated in every workshop to help my learning journey. My curiousity to learn new skills extends beyond Makers where I began the AWS Cloud Practioner course after a discussion with a software developer and understanding the benefits of serverless/containerised deployment.
