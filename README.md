## Felix Piercy

Ambitious and sociable individual at the beginning of a long-term career shift into technology. Originally a Liberal Arts grad from the University of Exeter, I began my career in Sales at a finance SME - helping start-ups develop the financial models and pitch decks which can be used to raise private investment upwards of Â£500k. I am a person who learns by doing, and I take great pleasure in building code that delivers a working output. Squashing bugs and finding those tiny errors is always pleasing (although painful at the time!).

## Coding Projects

FizzBuzz! Need I say more. This is an early prgramme I have built with one of my coding pairs. We also have started using rspec to automatically check the code. Coded in Ruby.              

Directory Build - Created a directory to store multiple values and retrieve data using a variety of techniques. Created in Ruby.

## Skills

Pair programming has been a central part of my software development course, providing daily opportunities to explain my code and how I have tackled problems - as well as listening to feedback and implementing improvements.
